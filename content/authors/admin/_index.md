My passion is everything related to speech: production, perception, automatic processing, or extracting linguistic and paralinguistic information.
I have years of experience in research, development and deployment of solutions for the purpose of speech processing, speech-to-text, speech-to-speech,
and speech in medicine. My vision is to develop technologies to solve real-world problems which can improve people’s lives.
