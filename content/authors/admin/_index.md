My passion is everything related to speech: production, perception, automatic processing, extracting linguistic and paralinguistic information.
I have years of experience R&D for speech processing, speech-to-text, speech-to-speech, and speech in medicine. I want to focus on sharing fundamental
or state-of-the-art knowledge that I have experience with and find relavant. My goal is that this blog will serve as a roadmap for those who want to
get into the field or just deepen their knowledge.
